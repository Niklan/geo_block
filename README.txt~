About
------------
Creating blocks, the information to be displayed based on the current 
location of the user.

For example, for users in London can display the same information, 
but for visitors from New York is totally different.

Available geoservices:

ipgeobase.ru - for Russian cities. Return cyrillic names.
hostip.info - for EU.
Tell me if you know of a similar free service to the provision of the API, 
the feature will be added to the module.

It's important! Name cities are sensitive to the fact that you are using and 
the fact that the service returns.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the folder with the module in the directory /sites/all/modules/
2. Enable module Geo Block
